Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics
over four years following an income shock (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)),
we assess the eﬀectiveness of three ﬁscal stimulus policies employed during recent
recessions. Unemployment insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck”
winner, especially when eﬀectiveness is measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are
second best and have the advantage (over UI) of being scalable to any desired size. A
temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less eﬀective than
the other policies and has negligible eﬀects in the version of our model without a
multiplier.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Fiscal policies that aim to boost consumer spending in recessions have been tried in many
countries in recent years. The nature of these policies has varied widely, perhaps because
traditional macroeconomic models have not provided plausible guidance about which policies
are likely to be most eﬀective - either in a welfare metric (reducing misery) or a GDP metric
(increasing output).
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  But a new generation of macro models has shown that when microeconomic heterogeneity
across consumer circumstances (wealth; income; education) is taken into account, the
consequences of an income shock for consumer spending depend on a measurable object: the
intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (IMPC) introduced in <a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">Auclert, Rognlie, and
Straub</a> (<a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">2018</a>). Fortuitously, new sources of microeconomic data, particularly from
Scandinavian national registries, have recently allowed the ﬁrst reasonably credible
measurements of the IMPC (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  This combination of developments makes it possible, really for the ﬁrst time, to conduct
quantitatively credible structural analyses of the likely eﬀectiveness of alternative consumption
stimulus policy choices - in both welfare and GDP terms.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  Here, we construct a heterogeneous agent (HA) model calibrated to match both the
measured IMPC and a measure of the distribution of liquid assets across consumers. The main
innovation in our model (relative to the existing HA macro literature) is introduced to allow our
model to match a substantial body of evidence—from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>) and
elsewhere<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a>  —that
a change in income induces a disproportionate change in spending immediately.
The immediate change is disproportionate in the sense that a model of optimal
nondurable consumption spending does not match the measured steep falloﬀ
in spending between the ﬁrst period after the income shock and subsequent
periods.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f2"></a>  
We capture this fact by assuming that consumers spend a ﬁxed fraction of their
labor income each period, which we call the “splurge” factor. This spending occurs
regardless of their current wealth and ﬁts with the empirical evidence that even
high-liquid-wealth households have high initial marginal propenisites to consume (MPCs) (see
<a 
href="#XcrawleyMicroMacro">Crawley and Kuchler</a> (<a 
href="#XcrawleyMicroMacro">Forthcoming</a>), and the extensive literature cited therein). By
contrast, in a standard one- or two-asset buﬀer-stock model, high-liquid-wealth
households smooth their consumption through transitory shocks and exhibit low
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
MPCs.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2003f3"></a>  
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  The resulting structural model could be used to evaluate a wide variety of consumption
stimulus policies. Here, we use it to evaluate three policies that have been implemented in
recent recessions in the United States (and elsewhere): an extension of unemployment
insurance (UI) beneﬁts, a means-tested stimulus check, and a payroll tax cut. (We assume all
these policies are debt ﬁnanced; see section <a 
href="#x1-40002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:model --></a> for details.)
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  Our ﬁrst metric of policy eﬀectiveness is “multiplication bang for the buck”: For a dollar of
spending on a particular policy, how much multiplication is induced? Timing matters because
in our model the size of any “consumption multiplier” depends on the economic conditions
that prevail when the extra spending occurs. Our strategy to illuminate this point is twofold.
First, we calculate the policy-induced spending dynamics in an economy with no multiplier
(and therefore with no multiplication bang for the buck). Then we make the assumption
that there is an aggregate demand externality during recessions but there is still no
multiplication for spending that occurs after our simulated recession is over. A less stark
assumption (for example, the degree of multiplication depends on the distance of
the economy from its steady state, or the endogenous time-varying multiplication
that arises in a New-Keynesian model) would perhaps be more realistic but also
much harder to assess clearly. Our on-oﬀ multiplier is possible because we follow
<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>)’s approach to modeling the aggregate demand
externality.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  Because our model’s outcomes reﬂect the behavior of utility-maximizing consumers, we can
calculate another, possibly more interesting, measure of the eﬀectiveness of alternative
policies: their eﬀect on consumers’ welfare. Even without multiplication, a utility-based metric
can justify countercyclical policy because the larger idiosyncratic shocks to income that occur
during a recession may justify a greater-than-normal degree of social insurance. We call this
‘welfare bang for the buck.’
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  The principal diﬀerence between the two metrics is that what matters for the degree of
spending multiplication is how much of the policy-induced extra spending occurs during the
recession (when the multiplier matters), while eﬀectiveness in the utility metric also depends
on who is doing the extra spending (because diﬀerent recipients have very diﬀerent marginal
utilities).
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  In the case of the policies compared here, an advantage of the stimulus checks (as we model
them) is that they are distributed immediately upon commencement of the recession, at which
point the multiplier is fully in force; our model implies that much of the induced extra
spending occurs soon enough that it is multiplied. Because “extended” UI payments may be
made after the recession is over, a substantial proportion of UI-extension-induced spending
will occur when there is no multiplier. However, the fact that UI recipients have
a high MPC implies that the <span 
class="ecti-1200">utility </span>consequences of the UI policy for them will
still be considerable, even if their post-recession spending does not get multiplied
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
(section <a 
href="#x1-190004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:comparing --></a>).
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >  Because high-MPC consumers have high marginal utility, a standard aggregated
welfare function would favor redistribution to such consumers even in the absence of
a recession. We are interested in the degree of <span 
class="ecti-1200">extra </span>motivation for redistributive
policies present in a recession, so we construct our social welfare metric speciﬁcally to
measure only the <span 
class="ecti-1200">incremental </span>social welfare eﬀect of alternative policies during
recessions (beyond whatever redistributional logic might apply during expansions – see
section <a 
href="#x1-250004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a>).
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >  Recessions are unexpected (they are “MIT shocks”) and double the unemployment rate
and the average length of unemployment spells. The end of the recession occurs
as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an average recession length of six quarters,
leading to a return of the unemployment rate to normal levels over time. When the
multiplier is active, any reduction in aggregate consumption below its steady-state level
directly reduces aggregate productivity and thus labor income. Hence, any policy
stimulating consumption will also boost incomes through this aggregate demand multiplier
channel.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  Our results are intuitive.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  In the economy with no recession multiplier, the beneﬁt of a sustained wage tax cut is small.
One reason there is any beneﬁt at all, even for people who have not experienced an
unemployment spell, is that the heightened risk of unemployment during a recession
increases the marginal value of current income because it helps them build extra
precautionary reserves to buﬀer against the extra risk. A second beneﬁt is that, by the
time a person does become unemployed, the temporary tax reduction will have
allowed them to accumulate a larger buﬀer to sustain them during unemployment.
Finally, in a recession, there are more people who will have experienced a spell of
unemployment, and the larger population of beneﬁciaries means that the consequences of
the prior mechanism will be greater. But, quantitatively, all of these eﬀects are
small.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >  When a multiplier exists, the tax cut has more beneﬁts, especially if the recession continues
long enough that most of the spending induced by the tax cut happens while the economy is
still in recession (and the multiplier still is in force). The typical recession, however, ends long
before our “sustained” wage tax cut is reversed—and even longer before lower-MPC consumers
have spent down most of their extra after-tax income. Accordingly, even in an economy with a
multiplier that is powerful during recessions, much of the wage tax cut’s eﬀect on
consumption occurs when any multiplier that might have existed in a recession is no longer
operative.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  Even leaving aside any multiplier eﬀects, the stimulus checks have more value than the wage
tax cut, because at least a portion of such checks go to people who are unemployed and
therefore have both high MPCs and high marginal utilities (while wage tax cuts, by
deﬁnition, go only to persons who are employed and earning wages). The greatest
“welfare bang for the buck” comes from the UI insurance extension, because almost
<span 
class="ecti-1200">all </span>of the recipients are in circumstances in which they have a high MPC and a
high marginal utility, whether or not the multiplier aggregate demand externality
exists.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >  And, in contrast to the wage-tax cut, both the UI extension and the stimulus checks
concentrate most of the marginal increment to consumption at times when the multiplier (if it
exists) is still powerful. A disadvantage of the UI extension, in terms of “multiplied bang for
the buck,” is that more of any extended UI payouts are likely to occur after the recession is
over (when, by assumption, there is no multiplication). Countering this disadvantage is the
fact that the MPC of UI recipients is higher than that of stimulus check recipients; in the end,
our model says that these two forces roughly balance each other, so that the “multiplied
bang for the buck” of the two policies is similar. In the welfare metric, however,
there is still considerable marginal value to UI recipients who receive their beneﬁts
after the recession is over (and no multiplier exists), so in the welfare metric, the
relative value of UI beneﬁts is increased compared with the policy of sending stimulus
checks.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >  We conclude that extended UI beneﬁts should be the ﬁrst weapon employed from this
arsenal, as they have a greater welfare beneﬁt than stimulus checks and a similar “multiplied
bang for the buck.” But a disadvantage is that the total amount of stimulus that
can be accomplished with the UI extension is constrained by the fact that only a
limited number of people become unemployed. If more stimulation is called for than
can be accomplished via the UI extension, checks have the advantage that their
eﬀects scale almost linearly in the size of the stimulus. The wage tax cut is also, in
principle, scalable, but its eﬀects are smaller than those of checks because recipients
have lower MPCs and marginal utility than check and UI recipients. In the real
world, a tax cut is also likely the least ﬂexible of the three tools: UI beneﬁts can be
further extended, and multiple rounds of checks can be sent, but multiple rounds of
changes in wage tax rates would likely be administratively and politically more
diﬃcult.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >  The policies we analyze here are deliberately stylized and therefore may not match any
particular policy actually implemented historically. But the tools we are using could be easily
modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other policies. For example, in the COVID-19 recession, not
only was the duration of UI beneﬁts extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by
very substantial extra payments to every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model to
match this particular policy, but the framework could easily accommodate such an
analysis.

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >This paper is closely related to the empirical literature that aims to estimate the eﬀect of
transitory income shocks and stimulus payments. In particular, we focus on <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm,
and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), who use Norwegian administrative panel data with sizable lottery wins to
estimate the MPC out of transitory income in the quarter it is obtained, as well as the pattern
of expenditure in the following quarters. We take their estimates as an input and build a
model that is consistent with the patterns they identify. The empirical literature

href="#Xbroda2014economic">Broda and
Parker</a> (<a 
href="#Xbroda2014economic">2014</a>). Both of these papers exploit the eﬀectively random timing of the distribution
of the payments and identify a substantial consumption response. In our model,
consumers do not adjust their labor supply in response to the stimulus policies, which is
broadly consistent with the empirical ﬁndings in <a 
href="#Xganong2022spending">Ganong, Greig, Noel, Sullivan, and
Vavra</a> (<a 
href="#Xganong2022spending">2022</a>). All these results indicate a substantial MPC that is diﬃcult to reconcile with
representative agent models that tend to imply that transitory income shocks are mostly
smoothed.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >  Thus, the paper also relates to the literature presenting models with hetergeneous agents
(“HA models”) that are built to be consistent with the evidence from micro-data discussed
earlier. A key example is <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>), who build a model where agents save in
both liquid and illiquid assets. In their model, they obtain a substantial consumption response
to a stimulus payment, since MPCs are high both for constrained, low-wealth households and
for households with substantial net worth that is mainly invested in the illiquid asset (the
“wealthy hand-to-mouth”). <a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, and White</a> (<a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">2020</a>) present
an HA model that is similar in many respects to the one we study. Their focus is
on predicting the consumption response to the 2020 U.S. CARES Act, a policy
implemented in the spring of that year when a lockdown was in place to limit the spread of
the coronavirus. The policy contains both an extension of unemployment beneﬁts
and a stimulus check. However, neither of these papers attempts to evaluate and
rank diﬀerent stimulus policies implemented in “normal” recessions, as we do in this
paper.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >  In more recent work, <a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">2022</a>) discuss diﬀerent mechanisms used in HA
models to obtain a high MPC and the tension between that work and ﬁtting the wealth
distribution. We use one of these mechanisms, ex-ante heterogeneity in discount factors, but
also extend the model to include splurge consumption. We obtain a model that delivers both
high average MPCs and a distribution of liquid wealth consistent with the data.
Therefore, our model does not suﬀer from what <a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">2022</a>) refers to as
the “missing middle” problem. In addition, we focus not only on the initial MPC,
but also on the propensity to spend out a windfall for several quarters after it is
obtained.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >  One of the criteria we use to rank policies is the ﬁscal multiplier, and our paper therefore
relates to the vast literature discussing the size of the multiplier. Our focus is on policies
implemented in the aftermath of the Great Recession, a period when monetary policy was
essentially ﬁxed at the zero lower bound (ZLB). We therefore do not consider alternative
monetary policy responses to the policies we evaluate, and our work thus relates to papers
such as <a 
href="#Xchristiano2011government">Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo</a> (<a 
href="#Xchristiano2011government">2011</a>) and <a 
href="#Xeggertsson2011fiscal">Eggertsson</a> (<a

that ﬁscal multipliers are higher in such circumstances. <a 
href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">Hagedorn, Manovskii, and
Mitman</a> (<a 
href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">2019</a>) present an HA model with both incomplete markets and nominal
rigidities to evaluate the size of the ﬁscal multiplier in a rich setting. They also
ﬁnd that the multiplier is higher when monetary policy is constrained at the ZLB.
However, the key to their result is not that the nominal rate is stuck at zero, but
that it does not respond to the ﬁscal policy they consider. Unlike us, they focus
on government spending and are interested in diﬀerent options for ﬁnancing that
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
spending. They do not consider the diﬀerent policies involving transfers directly
to households that we study. <a 
href="#Xramey2018government">Ramey and Zubairy</a> (<a 
href="#Xramey2018government">2018</a>) investigate empirically,
using a long historical dataset, whether there is support for the model-based results
that ﬁscal multipliers are higher in certain states. They also focus on government
spending and ﬁnd that the multipliers are generally low. While there is some evidence
that multipliers are higher when there is slack in the economy or the ZLB binds,
the multipliers they ﬁnd are still below one in most speciﬁcations. In any case, we
condition on policies being implemented in a recession—when, this literature argues,
multipliers are higher—but it is not crucial for our purposes whether the multipliers
are greater than one or not. We are concerned with relative multipliers, and the
multiplier is only one of the two criteria we use to rank the diﬀerent policies we
consider.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >  We also introduce a measure of welfare to rank policies. Thus, the paper relates to the
recent literature on welfare comparisons in HA models. Both <a

into diﬀerent terms. In the former case, these are aggregate eﬃciency, redistribution and
insurance, while the latter further decomposes the insurance component into intra- and
intertemporal components. Even though both of these papers are related, our focus is not on
decomposing welfare eﬀects into diﬀerent components. We want to (1) use a welfare measure
as an additional way of ranking policies and (2) introduce a measure that abstracts
from any incentive for a planner to redistribute in the steady state (or “normal”
times).

unemployment insurance in the period from 2008 to 2014. He ﬁnds that this extension raised
aggregate demand and implied a lower unemployment rate than without the extension.
However, he does not attempt to compare the stimulus eﬀects of extending unemployment
insurance with other policies.

  Consumers face a stochastic income process with permanent and transitory shocks to
income, along with unemployment shocks. In normal times, consumers receive unemployment
beneﬁts for two quarters before they run out. Permanent income in the model is described by
the following equation:

<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >We model the arrival of a recession, and the government policy response to it, as an
unpredictable event—an MIT shock. We have four types of shocks: one representing a
recession and one for each of the three diﬀerent policy responses we consider. The policy
responses are usually modeled as in addition to the recession, but we also consider a
counterfactual in which the policy response occurs without a recession in order to understand
the welfare eﬀects of the policy.

class="ecbx-1200">Recession.</span></span>
  At the onset of a recession, several changes occur. First, the unemployment rate for each
education group doubles: Those who would have been unemployed in the absence of a
recession are still unemployed, and an additional number of consumers move from employment
to unemployment. Second, conditional on the recession continuing, the employment transition
matrix is adjusted so that unemployment remains at the new high level and the expected
length of time for an unemployment spell increases. In our baseline calibration, discussed in
detail in section <a 
href="#x1-170003.3">3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:calib --></a>, we set the expected length of an unemployment spell to one
and a half quarters in normal times, and this length increases to four quarters in a
recession. Third, the end of the recession occurs as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an
average length of recession of six quarters. Finally, at the end of a recession, the
employment transition matrix switches back to its original probabilities, and, as
a result, the unemployment rate trends down over time, back to its steady-state
level.

  In this policy response, the government sends money to every consumer that directly
increases the individual’s market resources. The checks are means-tested depending on
permanent income. A check for $1,200 is sent to every consumer with permanent income less
than $100,000, and this amount is then linearly reduced to zero for consumers with a
permanent income greater than $150,000.

  In this policy response, unemployment beneﬁts are extended from two quarters to four
quarters. That is, those who become unemployed at the start of the recession, or who were
already unemployed, will receive unemployment beneﬁts for up to four quarters (including
quarters leading up to the recession). Those who become unemployed one quarter into the
recession will receive up to three quarters of unemployment beneﬁts. These extended
unemployment beneﬁts will occur regardless of whether the recession ends, and no further
extensions are granted if the recession continues.

  In this policy response, employee-side payroll taxes are reduced for a period of eight quarters.
During this period, which continues irrespective of whether the recession continues or ends,
employed consumers’ income is increased by 2 percent. The income of unemployed consumers
is unchanged by this policy. Consumers also believe there is a 50-50 chance that the tax cut

  Some work in the HA macro literature has shown that if taxes are raised immediately to
oﬀset any ﬁscal stimulus, results can be very diﬀerent than they would be if, as occurs in
reality, recessionary policies are debt ﬁnanced. Typical ﬁscal rules assume that any increase in
debt gets ﬁnanced over a long interval. Since much of our analysis eﬀectively normalizes our
policies’ size so that the total cost of each policy (and therefore the associated debt) is the
same, almost all of the eﬀects of any particular ﬁscal rule should be very similar for each of
our policies so long as the great majority of the debt is repaid after the short recessionary
period that is our main focus.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >  To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we assume that our policies are debt ﬁnanced
and that none of the policy-induced government debt is repaid during that short period.
Any of a variety of ﬁscal rules could be imposed for the period following our short
period of interest, but we did not want to choose any particular ﬁscal rule in order to
avoid making a choice that should have little consequence for our key question.
Advocates of alternative ﬁscal rules likely already have intuitions about how such
rules’ economic consequences diﬀer, but under our approach, those consequences
should be nearly the same for all three policies we consider. Alternative choices of
ﬁscal rules should therefore not aﬀect the ranking of policies that is our principal

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >This section describes how we set the model’s parameters. First, we estimate the
extent to which consumers ‘splurge’ when receiving an income shock. We do so using
Norwegian data to allow the model to match the best available evidence on the
time proﬁle of the marginal propensity to spend provided by <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>). For this exercise, we use a version of the model calibrated to the Norwegian
economy.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  Second, we calibrate the full model on U.S. data, taking the splurge factor as given from the
Norwegian calibration. In the model, agents diﬀer according to their level of education and
their subjective discount factors. Finally, a distribution of subjective discount factors is
estimated separately for each education group to match features of each within-group liquid
wealth distribution.

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >We deﬁne splurging as the free spending of current labor income without concern for
intertemporal maximization of utility. The splurge allows us to capture the shorter- and
longer-term response of consumption to income shocks, especially for consumers with
signiﬁcant liquid wealth, that a standard model cannot. Speciﬁcally, we show that our
model can account well for the results of <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), who
study the eﬀect of lottery winnings in Norway on consumption using millions of
records from the Norwegian population registry. Using their results, we calibrate our
model to reﬂect the Norwegian economy and estimate the splurge factor, as well
as the distribution of discount factors in the population, to match two empirical
moments.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  First, we take from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>) the marginal propensity to consume
out of a one-period income shock. We target not only the initial response of consumption to
the income shock, but also the subsequent eﬀect on consumption in years one through four
after the shock. The shares of lottery winnings expended at diﬀerent time horizons, as
found in <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a

initial annual MPC because the lottery winnings may occur toward the end of the
year.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  Second, we match the steady-state distribution of liquid wealth in the

wealth distribution in Norway, we use the corresponding data from the United

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Before we move on to the parameterization of the full model, we describe in detail the data
that we use to get measures of permanent income, liquid wealth, and the division of
households into educational groups in the United States. We use data on the distribution of
liquid wealth from the 2004 wave of the SCF. We restrict our attention to households where
the head is of working age, which we deﬁne to be in the range from 25 to 62. The SCF-variable
“normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent income, and, to exclude
outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5 percent of the distribution of
this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for households in our sample is thus
$16,708.

market, checking, savings, and call accounts; directly held mutual funds; and stocks and
bonds. We subtract oﬀ liquid debt, which is the revolving debt on credit card balances. Note
that the SCF does not contain information on cash holdings, so these are imputed with the
procedure described in Appendix B.1 of <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a

credit card balances that are considered part of liquid debt. We drop any households that have
negative liquid wealth.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >  Households are classiﬁed into three educational groups. The ﬁrst group, “Dropout,”
applies to households where the head of household has not obtained a high school
diploma; the second group, “Highschool,” includes heads of households who have a high

without obtaining a bachelor’s degree; and the third group, “College,” consists of
heads of households who have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher. With this

<!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >  When consumers are born, they receive an initial level of permanent income. This initial
value is drawn from a log-normal distribution that depends on the education level the
household is born with. For each education group, the parameters of the distribution
are determined by the mean and standard deviation of log-permanent income for
households of age 25 in that education group in the SCF 2004. For the Dropout group,
the mean initial value of quarterly permanent income is $6,200; for the Highschool
group, it is $11,100; and for the College group, it is $14,500. The standard deviations
of the log-normal distributions for each group are, respectively, <img

MPCs relative to wealth, and (2) we calibrate to liquid wealth rather than total
wealth.

<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-21001r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessioncheckrelrecession --></a> shows the impulse response of income and consumption when stimulus checks are
issued in the ﬁrst quarter of a recession. In the model without a multiplier, the stimulus checks
account for 5.5 percent of the ﬁrst quarter’s income. In the following quarters, there are no
further stimulus payments, and income remains the same as it would have been without the
stimulus check policy. Consumption is about 3 percent higher in the ﬁrst quarter, which
includes the splurge response to the stimulus check. Consumption then drops to less than 1
percent above the counterfactual, and the remainder of the stimulus check money is then spent
over the next few years. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income in the
ﬁrst quarter is 6.5 percent higher than the counterfactual, as the extra spending
feeds into higher incomes. Consumption in this model jumps to a higher level than
without aggregate demand eﬀects and comes down more slowly as the feedback eﬀects
from consumption to income damp the speed with which income—and hence the
splurge—return to zero. After a couple of years, when the recession is most likely over and
aggregate demand eﬀects are no longer in place, income is close to where it would
be without the stimulus check policy, although consumption remains somewhat
elevated.

<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  The impulse responses in ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-22001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessionuirelrecession --></a> show the response to a policy that extends unemployment
beneﬁts from 6 months to 12 months for a period of a year. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, the path for income now depends on the number of consumers who receive
the extended unemployment beneﬁts. These consumers are those who have been
unemployed for between 6 and 12 months. In the ﬁrst quarter of the recession, the newly
unemployed receive unemployment beneﬁts regardless of whether they are extended or not.
Therefore, it is in the second and third quarters, when the eﬀects of the recession on
long-term unemployment start to materialize, that the extended UI payments ramp up,
amounting to an aggregate increase in quarterly income by 0.7 percent. By the ﬁfth
quarter, the policy is no longer in eﬀect, and income from extended unemployment
goes to zero. Consumption in the ﬁrst quarter jumps by more than income (by 0.4
percent), prompted by both the increase in expected income and the reduced need for
precautionary saving given the extended insurance. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, consumption is only a little above the counterfactual by the time
the policy is over. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, there is an extra
boost to income of about the same size in the ﬁrst and second quarters. As this
extra aggregate demand induced income goes to employed consumers, more of it is
saved, and consumption remains elevated several quarters beyond the end of the
policy.

href="#x1-23001r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessiontaxcutrelrecession --></a>, shows the impulse response for a payroll tax cut
that persists for two years (eight quarters). In the model without aggregate demand eﬀects,
income rises by close to 2 percent as the take-home pay for employed consumers goes up. After
the two-year period, income drops back to where it would have been without the
payroll tax cut. Consumption jumps close to 1.5 percent in response to the tax cut.
Over the period in which the tax cut is in eﬀect, consumption rises somewhat as
the stock of precautionary savings goes up, before declining in anticipation of the
drop in income at the two-year mark. Following the drop in income, consumption
drops sharply because of the splurge and then decreases over time as consumers
spend out the savings they built up over the period the tax cut was in eﬀect. In
the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income rises by about 2.5 percent above
the counterfactual and then declines steadily as the probability that the recession
remains active—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀects in place—goes down over
time.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In response to the now declining expected path for income over the two years during which the
tax cut remains in place, consumption also declines, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
Following the end of the policy, the savings stock in the model with aggregate demand
eﬀects is high, and consumption remains signiﬁcantly elevated through the period
shown.

href="#x1-24003r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> shows the
long-run multiplier for each policy. The stimulus check, which is paid out in quarter
one, exhibits the largest multiplier on impact. About 60 percent of the total policy
expenditure is immediately spent by consumers. After one year, and because of the
aggregate demand eﬀects, consumption has increased cumulatively by more than
the cost of the stimulus check. Over time, the policy reaches a total multiplier of
1.343.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >  The multiplier is slightly lower for the UI extension policy than the stimulus check over
most horizons. Since spending for the UI policy is spread out over four quarters (and peaks in
quarters two to three), the multiplier in the ﬁrst quarter is considerably lower than in the case
of the stimulus check. The UI extension policy is targeted in the sense that it provides
additional income to only those consumers, who, because of unemployment, have large MPCs.
However, it is slow to roll out, and some of the spending occurs at later quarters, when the
recession might have ended. Overall, around 80 percent of the policy expenditure occurs
during the recession. In contrast, the stimulus check is paid out fully during the ﬁrst quarter,
when, by construction, the recession occurs with certainty. Therefore, the aggregate demand
eﬀects are particularly potent for the stimulus check policy despite being less targeted
and providing stimulus also to agents with low MPCs relative to the extended UI
policy.

<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut has the lowest multiplier irrespective of the considered horizon. A
multiplier of 1 is reached only after around 15 quarters. The total multiplier over the whole
simulated period is at approximately 1.079. These relatively small numbers reﬂect that policy
spending lasts for a long time and is thus more likely to occur after the recession has ended.
Moreover, only employed consumers, often with relatively low MPCs, beneﬁt directly from the
payroll tax cut. Therefore, the policy is poorly targeted if the goal is to provide short-term
stimulus.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-24003r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> contains an additional (middle) row. To understand these values note that the
policies initially increase the income of consumers directly, which leads to a boost in
consumption. As a consequence, this boost triggers an aggregate demand eﬀect which
increases the income of everyone and in turn leads to an additional boost to consumption. We
refer to the sum of this initial and the indirect boost to consumption as the ﬁrst-round
AD eﬀect. However, the AD eﬀect continues as the indirect boost to consumption
triggers another round of income increases which further boost consumption and
so on. One might argue that these higher-order rounds of the AD eﬀect are not
likely to be anticipated by consumers. Since higher-order consumption boosts only
materialize if consumers anticipate them and act accordingly, the overall increase in
consumption might turn out to be smaller than suggested by the full AD eﬀect. The
middle row of the table shows the multipliers that result in the special case where we
only consider the ﬁrst-round AD eﬀect. As expected, the multipliers are smaller
when excluding higher-order rounds. Nevertheless, the ranking of the policies remain
unchanged. However, we observe that in the case of the tax cut, approximately half
of the total stimulus eﬀect occurs in the ﬁrst round, with that proportion being
somewhat larger for the other two policies. This reﬂects that the stimulus impact
of the tax cut hinges to a larger extent on higher-order spillovers from the direct
beneﬁciaries of the policy to those indirectly aﬀected by the aggregate demand eﬀect as
compared to the stimulus check or the UI extension, which directly target high-MPC
households.

The table shows consumption-equivalent welfare gains in basis points, which are to be
interpreted as follows. A welfare gain of <img 
src="HAFiscal148x.svg" alt="x  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> implies that the social planner is indiﬀerent
between the stimulus policy being implemented in response to a recession and a permanent
increase in the baseline consumption of the total population by <img 
src="HAFiscal149x.svg" alt="x  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> basis points (that is a
one-hundredth of 1 percent of the baseline consumption). We will, however, ﬁrst discuss the
relative diﬀerences across the policies and then discuss the magnitude of the welfare
eﬀects.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >  Without aggregate demand eﬀects (the ﬁrst row of the table), the payroll tax cut has
extremely limited welfare beneﬁts compared with the other policies. The reason is that the
payroll tax cut goes to consumers who remain employed, and therefore it does not directly
aﬀect the unemployed consumers who are the most hit by the recession. However, employed
consumers do reduce their consumption at the onset of the recession because of the increased
unemployment risk, so the tax cut helps them more than in nonrecessionary times.
Similarly, the stimulus check has limited beneﬁts relative to the UI policy, as it mostly
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
goes to employed consumers, although it has the beneﬁt over the payroll tax cut of
also reaching the unemployed. The extended UI policy is the clear “bang for the
buck” winner, as all the payments go to unemployed households who are likely to
have signiﬁcantly higher marginal utility for consumption than in nonrecessionary
times.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >  The second row of the table shows the welfare beneﬁts in the version of the model with
aggregate demand eﬀects during the recession. The payroll tax cut now has a noticeable
beneﬁt, as some of the tax cut gets spent during the recession, resulting in higher incomes for
all consumers. However, the tax cut is received over a period of two years, and much of the
relief may be after the recession—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀect—is over.
Furthermore, because the payroll tax cut goes only to employed consumers who have relatively
lower MPCs, the spending out of this stimulus will be further delayed, possibly beyond the
period of the recession. By contrast, the stimulus check is received in the ﬁrst period of the
recession and goes to both employed and unemployed consumers. The earlier arrival and
higher MPCs of the stimulus check recipients mean more of the stimulus is spent during the
recession, leading to greater aggregate demand eﬀects, higher income, and higher welfare. The
extended UI arrives, on average, slightly later than the stimulus check. However,
the recipients, who have been unemployed for at least six months, spend the extra
beneﬁts relatively quickly, resulting in signiﬁcant aggregate demand eﬀects during
the recession. In contrast to the payroll tax cut, extended UI has the beneﬁt of
automatically reducing if the recession ends early, making fewer consumers eligible for the
beneﬁt.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >  The welfare eﬀects for the UI extension are largest compared with other stimulus policies
when those policies are scaled down to match the total expenditure size of the UI extension
policy. Nevertheless, the welfare eﬀect of the UI extension is relatively modest, amounting to
only 1.266 basis points of baseline consumption. However, while the UI extension policy
cannot be easily scaled to a larger size, scaling is certainly possible for the stimulus check. If
we consider a $1,200 stimulus check rather than the $80 check underlying the calculations in
table <a 
href="#x1-25015r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare --></a>, we obtain—using a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation—a welfare gain equivalent

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >The results presented in sections <a

href="#x1-250004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a> indicate that the extension of unemployment
beneﬁts is the clear “bang for the buck” winner. The extended UI payments are well
targeted to consumers with high MPCs and high marginal utility, giving rise to large
multipliers and welfare improvements. The stimulus checks come in about equal
when measured by their multiplier eﬀect but are a distant second when measured by
their welfare eﬀects. The stimulus checks have large multipliers because the money
gets to consumers at the beginning of the recession and is therefore most likely
to be spent during the recession when spending passes through to productivity.
However, the checks are not well targeted to high-MPC consumers, so even though
the funds arrive early in the recession, they are spent out more slowly than the
extended unemployment beneﬁts. Furthermore, the average recipient of a stimulus
check has a much lower marginal utility than consumers receiving unemployment
beneﬁts, so the welfare beneﬁts of this policy are substantially muted relative to UI
extensions.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut policy does poorly by both measures: It has a low overall
multiplier and negligible welfare beneﬁts. The reasons are that the funds are slow
to arrive, so the subsequent spending often occurs after the end of the recession,
and that the payments are particularly badly targeted—they go only to employed
consumers.
<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >  While it is clear from the analysis that the extended unemployment beneﬁts should be the
ﬁrst tool to use, a disadvantage of them is that they are limited in their size. If a larger ﬁscal
stimulus is deemed appropriate, then stimulus checks provide an alternative option that will
stimulate spending during the recession even if the welfare beneﬁts are substantially lower
than the UI extension.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we analyze how sensitive our results are to some of the parameters in the
model. In particular, we focus on parameters that heavily inﬂuence consumers’ incentives to
save. These parameters are (1) the interest rate that aﬀects the returns on saving and (2) the
degree of risk aversion and the replacement rates when unemployed with or without beneﬁts
that aﬀect the strength of a precautionary saving motive. The aim is to alter these incentives
while maintaining the requirement that the distributions of liquid wealth in each education
group match the distributions in the data. Hence, in each case, we re-estimate the
distributions of discount factors in each education group (and, if necessary, the degree of
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
splurge spending in consumption). The aim is thus to compute new results for a model with
diﬀerent parameters that also ﬁts data on the distribution of liquid wealth. At the end of the
section, we also consider how changing the properties of the recession aﬀects our main
results.

Higher interest rates result in higher welfare beneﬁts, as measured in lifetime consumption
units, for all policies because the beneﬁts of the policies (in the numerator) are
front-loaded compared with a proportional increase in consumption through all periods
(in the denominator). Thus, increasing the interest rate—which is also the social
planner’s discount rate—reduces the value of a proportional increase in consumption by
more than the consumption increases associated with each policy. Nevertheless, the
qualitative result that the extended UI beneﬁts provide by far the highest welfare
gains, followed by the stimulus checks, is strongly robust to changes in the interest
rate.

makes the precautionary saving motive stronger for all consumers in that group.
Ceteris paribus, these consumers would then increase the amount of liquid wealth
they accumulate, and the median liquid-wealth-to-permanent-income ratio for the
education group would increase. For all the education groups, the discount factor

<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >  The strength of the precautionary saving motive, however, is determined by more than just
risk aversion. The risks that households face also drive the strength of this motive for
saving, and in our model, a key risk is unemployment risk. Therefore, the replacement
rates that households face when they are unemployed with or without beneﬁts play
an important role. In section <a

<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we conduct the welfare analysis for diﬀerent values of risk aversion. A
higher risk aversion implies a greater welfare loss associated with the same drop in
consumption, and thus, a greater welfare gain for policies that reduce the consumption drop.
However, changing the risk-aversion parameter has a number of other ramiﬁcations for
our welfare measure that are diﬃcult to assess without simulation. A higher risk
aversion (ceteris paribus) induces agents to hold a higher buﬀer stock of savings,
making them less sensitive to adverse economic shocks in terms of their consumption
response. As argued earlier, and since we target the empirical wealth-to-income ratios,
we increase impatience to counteract this larger incentive to save. These changes
then aﬀect the consumption response of agents to the recession and to the policies
implemented.

<!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we alter two properties of the recession and study the eﬀect of those changes
(one at a time) on our main results. First, we lower the average length of a recession from six
quarters in the baseline to four quarters. Second, we increase the consumption elasticity of the
aggregate demand eﬀect, <img 
src="HAFiscal225x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle">, from 0.3 in the baseline to 0.5. In either case, the parameter
changes do not require a re-estimation of the discount factor distribution, since the baseline
saving behavior is unaﬀected by properties of the recession, which arrives as an MIT
shock.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-37001r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:robustness_recession_property_results --></a> presents the welfare results for diﬀerent properties of the recession. In case of
a shorter average recession length of four quarters, as opposed to six quarters, in
the baseline, we observe lower welfare eﬀects of the policies. As argued earlier, the
reason is that the policies are particularly eﬀective during recessions. Hence, the
additional spending induced by the policies is now less likely to occur while the
recession is ongoing. This outcome can also be seen by investigating the long-run
multipliers of the policies, which fall slightly for all three policies considered: from
1.339 in the baseline to 1.314 in case of the shorter recession length for the stimulus
check, from 1.275 to 1.255 for the UI extension, and from 1.079 to 1.042 for the tax
cut.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >  A higher value for <img 
src="HAFiscal226x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle">—and hence stronger aggregate demand eﬀects—considerably
increases the welfare eﬀects of each policy. Of course, this is only the case in the version of the
model with aggregate demand eﬀects. In their absence, there is no change in the welfare
results relative to the baseline calibration of the model. The larger <img 
src="HAFiscal227x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> implies a larger boost
to aggregate income in response to the demand eﬀects of the policies. This larger
boost translates to a larger increase in consumption and thus a stronger welfare
eﬀect. Under stronger AD eﬀects, the policies have also considerably larger long-run
multipliers. The stimulus check exhibits a multiplier of 1.811 (baseline: 1.339); the
UI extension, a multiplier of 1.633 (1.275); and the tax cut, a multiplier of 1.271
(1.079).

<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >The robustness checks in this section show that our main results are fairly robust to a wide
range of alternative parameter choices. We have shown that the ex-ante discount rates
can be adjusted so that the distribution of liquid wealth is well approximated in
the model. Furthermore, the distribution of liquid wealth appears to more or less
pin down the aggregate consumption properties for the model, regardless of the
other parameters. Importantly, none of the robustness checks alter the ranking of
policies in terms of their eﬀectiveness and therefore the overall conclusions of this
paper.
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >  Characteristics of the recession do, however, matter for our results. Shorter recessions or
those with smaller aggregate demand eﬀects reduce the eﬀectiveness of policies. Conversely,
more severe recessions will render the policies even more eﬃcient than our baseline results
suggest.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6  </span> <a 
 id="x1-390006"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >For many years leading up to the Great Recession, a widely held view among macroeconomists
was that countercyclical policy should be left to central banks, because ﬁscal policy responses
were unpredictable in their timing, their content, and their eﬀects. Nevertheless, even during
this period, ﬁscal policy responses to recessions were repeatedly tried, perhaps because the
macroeconomists’ advice to policymakers, “don’t just do something; stand there”—is not
politically tenable.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic modeling has ﬁnally advanced to the point
where we can make reasonably credible assessments of the eﬀects of alternative policies of the
kinds that have been tried. The key developments have been both the advent of national
registry datasets that can measure crucial microeconomic phenomena and the creation of tools
of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic modeling that can match those micro facts and glean
their macroeconomic implications.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  We examine three ﬁscal policy experiments that have actually been implemented in the
past: an extension of UI beneﬁts, a stimulus check, and a tax cut on labor income. Our model
suggests that the extension of UI beneﬁts is a clear “bang for the buck” winner. Not only is it
the policy that yields the greatest spending boost while the recession is ongoing (when
multipliers are likely to be strongest), but it also leads to the greatest welfare gains. The chief
drawback of the UI extension is that its size is limited by the fact that a relatively small share
of the population is aﬀected by it. In contrast, stimulus checks are easily scalable
while exhibiting only slightly less recession-period stimulus (in a typical recession).
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
However, since some of the stimulus checks ﬂow to well-oﬀ consumers, such checks do
worse than UI extensions when we evaluate welfare consequences. Finally, the tax
cut is the least eﬀective in terms of both the multiplier and welfare eﬀect, since it
targets only employed consumers and, for a typical recession, more of its payouts

ended.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  The tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other
policies. For example, in the COVID recession, not only was the duration of UI beneﬁts
extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by very substantial extra payments to
every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but the
framework could easily accommodate such an analysis.
