                   administrative panel data to explore how transitory
                   income shocks are spent and saved over time and how
                   households' marginal propensities to consume (MPCs)
                   vary with household characteristics and shock size.
                   We find that spending peaks in the year of winning
                   and gradually reverts to normal within five years.
                   Controlling for all items on households' balance
                   sheets and characteristics such as education and
                   income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets
                   that vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity
                   winners of the smallest prizes (around US\$1,500) are
                   estimated to spend all within the year of winning.
                   The corresponding estimate for high-liquidity winners
                   of large prizes (US\$8,300â€“150,000) is slightly
                   below one-half. While conventional models will
                   struggle to account for such high MPC levels, we show
                   that a two-asset life cycle model with a realistic
                   earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive can
                   account for both the time profile of consumption
                   responses and their systematic covariation with
                   observables.},

                   a large average marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
                   in heterogeneous agent models? Through a systematic
                   investigation of models with different preferences,
                   dimensions of ex-ante heterogeneity, income processes
                   and asset structure, we show that the most important
                   factor is the share and type of hand-to-mouth
                   households. One-asset models either feature a
                   trade-off between a high average MPC and a realistic
                   level of aggregate wealth, or generate an excessively
                   polarized wealth distribution that vastly understates
                   the wealth held by households in the middle of the
                   distribution. Two-asset models that include both
                   liquid and illiquid assets can resolve this tension
                   with a large enough gap between liquid and illiquid
                   returns. We discuss how such return differential can
                   be justified from the perspective of theory and
                   data.},

  abstract =      {We develop a novel medium-scale DSGE model, called
                   NORA, for fiscal policy analysis in Norway. NORA
                   contains a sheltered and exposed sector allowing us
                   to model wage bargaining between a labor union and
                   the exposed sector, reflecting Scandinavian wage
                   formation institutions. Wages are subject to a
                   downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR). Inspired by
                   many countries' fiscal policy responses to the Great
                   Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
                   investigate the model's ability to generate
                   state-dependent fiscal multipliers. We find, that
                   both the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates
                   and DNWR individually can account for higher fiscal
                   multipliers during recessions. In joint presence,
                   however, the existence of DNWR reduces the multiplier
                   at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly relaxes
                   the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
                   state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions
                   about the origin of the recession, the nature of the
                   fiscal stimulus and its financing source.},
